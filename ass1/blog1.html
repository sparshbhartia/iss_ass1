            <p>This is my first blog post. Welcome to my blog!<br><br>
                I would like to speak about my JEE advanced day in this blog.
                On the day of 4 th June ,2023 ,I was about to give the world's toughest exam ,the exam which I had prepared for 2 years.
                I got very nervous and excited at the same time.After preparing and eating breakfast,I left for the centre and reached
                there in 1 hour .The center hadn't opened yet(as usual) and I was pacing around while my dad was telling me to relax and 
                concentrate on exam(which didn't help at all).After eternity of walking (basically 5 minutes),I entered the centre and did 
                all the formalities and sat for the paper.After waiting for nearly an hour(because the exam was late(wait ,it reminds me of Some
                thing ,oh yeah IIITH timings)) the exam started.Imagine all the thoughts and imaginations running through my mind,the heart racing 
                faster then Usain Bolt.Well,none of this happened and I wrote the exam and felt it to be decent(according to my expectation) and 
                finished it.<br><br>When I returned to my dad,he asked how it went and all and gave me some cold wipes to help me for the next exam.After 
                eating lunch,my mind felt better and I was feeling confident about myself that I can crack JEE ADV.Boy ,was I wrong!I still feel angry
                about the horrifying twist this exam had for me.After filling the formalities (again!),I again sat for the exam.
                When the paper started,it turned out to be considerably tough but i went through it ,with some deep breaths and finished
                it.Well,the day was over ,and I still couldn't believe that my JEE journey was over.Those painstaking 2 years which I will never
                forget in my entire life.And that was the end of the day.(If you are still curious about my rank,go to the webiste and see 
                it .There is a reason I put it there).
